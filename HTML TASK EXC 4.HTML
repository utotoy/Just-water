            <h1 class="About_Us_Heading">Its Just Water</h1>
            <p class="About_text">JUST was sparked by the inspiration of a young man striving for positive change. During his surf lessons, ten-year-old Jaden Smith encountered a disconcerting sightâ€”a plastic bottle bobbing alongside him in the water. This impactful moment fueled his determination to take action against plastic pollution in the Pacific. What initially started as a personal realization of humanity's environmental impact evolved into a shared commitment within the Smith family to make a meaningful difference.

            Jaden Smith's encounter with the plastic bottle during his surfing experience ignited a passion for environmental responsibility. Disturbed by the prospect of plastic pollution in the ocean, the ten-year-old made a conscious decision to address this issue. What ensued was not just an individual effort but a collective family endeavor as the Smiths united in their shared obsession to contribute positively to the planet. The journey that began with a young surfer's revelation has since transformed into a broader mission to promote environmental well-being and inspire others to do the same.</p>
